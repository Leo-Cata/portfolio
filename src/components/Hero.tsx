              React Front-End Developer
            </span>
            , passionate about technology for as long as I can remember.&#10; At
            the end of September of 2022, I completed a React Front-End
            Bootcamp, and since then I've been learning and doing projects on my
            own.&#10; My goal is to become developer, building interactive
            websites that bring value to the businesses through my work while
            leveling my skills as a developer.&#10; I have studied English for 7
            years, graduating with a B2 level through the Cambridge FCE
            Examination and I use English in my day to day, from listening to
            music, watching movies, tv series to learning.
