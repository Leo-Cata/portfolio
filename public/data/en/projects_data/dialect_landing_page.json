  "title": "Dialect Landing Page",
  "objective": "Before this project, I was following tutorials, doing some challenges on codewars.com and frontendmentor.io, but I didn't want to get stuck in tutorial hell. To start with something  simple, I decided to follow a web design and make it into a website.",
  "features": "This is a simple website using mostly flexbox and includes a carousel as well as a dropdown menu made without any libraries; both dropdown menus are synched for the chosen option using Context API. Although a design for the mobile view wasn't included, I adapted it myself to make it fully responsive",
  "challenges": "I had small difficulties with flexbox, although I quickly understood how to make it work",
