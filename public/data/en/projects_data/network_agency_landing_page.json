  "title": "Network Agency Landing Page",
  "objective": "With this project, I wanted to learn TypeScript and keep improving my CSS skills. The design of this web page was perfect because a lot of the positioning was done with the absolute property",

  "features": "This landing page features a carousel, accordions and a mobile menu animated using Framer Motion. Lots of elements are positioned using absolute positioning in order to mirror the design I was following; everything is as modular as possible, maintaining clean code throughout the project.",

  "challenges": "The hardest part of this project was understanding absolute positioning in order to achieve the design I was following and everything not breaking for the mobile view.",

  "stack": "React as the frontend framework, although it wasn't really needed, TypeScript was used just as a way of learning the basics, framer motion for the animations, and TailwindCSS for the styling",
